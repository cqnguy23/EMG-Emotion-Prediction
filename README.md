# EMG-Emotion-Prediction

## Introduction:

The purpose of the project is to develop a prototype for a wearable device that can detect usersâ€™ emotions. The implementation of the device will be composed of three major parts: collecting electromyography (EMG) signals from three sensors, storing and analyzing the collected data utilizing machine learning, and displaying the prediction on a smartphone application.
